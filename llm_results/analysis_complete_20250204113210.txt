The double cloth filter blocks the pops and lets the voice through with no coloration. The metal clamp mount attaches to the mike stand secure enough to keep it attached. The goose neck needs a little coaxing to stay where you put it.'}, {'_id': ObjectId('679fe7f53f773d0a120ab15e'), 'input_text': 'Nice windscreen protects my MXL mic and prevents pops.

It looks and performs like a studio filter.

Love the heavy cord and gold connectors.  Bass sounds great.  I just learned last night how to coil them up.  I guess I should read instructions more carefully.

The lifetime warranty is worth the price alone. Simple fact: cables break, but getting to replace them at no cost is where it's at."}]
